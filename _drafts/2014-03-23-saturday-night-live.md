So after a full day of review and catch up work I'm coming home at 1130 pm on the train.  So here are some if the highlights of the past few days.

1. Getting healthy.  Much more fun to do this without a cold.  I hope that today's marathon session doesn't threaten that.

2. MVC.  It's a simple concept on paper, but tricky to start implementing concretely.  But it's the beginnings of a lot of fun stuff.  The ability to change or add features without creating too much havoc is brilliant.

3. Git add -p and git commit -v  Thus little tips and habits are things I'll do a billion times from here on out.

4. Sticking it out to really understand the basics of ruby and SQL so I can start using active record with a strong foundation.  It won't just be magic.

5. The learning curve if working in a group.  I get along well with people, but that doesn't mean I don't have a lit to learn in team dynamics.  I got to notice all these competing urges that arise when I'm teaming up. I want to be a facilitator. I want to be right. I'm afraid I will be outshone. I like structure over chaos. There is a lot if room for me to grow.

That's all for now.
