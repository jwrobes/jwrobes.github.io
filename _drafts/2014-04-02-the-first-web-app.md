title: Getting on the Web! 
---

So it has been a day of a few firsts.  The first web app.  A low budget version of Craigslist using Sinatra and postgress.  We had a group of three, which resulted in men tackling the challenge solo because three in one group doesn't work so well.  So it was a long slog of a day, with me unsure half way through how routes and parameters really worked.  But I pushed through, and ended the day with a functioning version of Craigslist.  Not bad, for one day.

The second first was not making it home.  I found myself working late at 11pm and my buddy whom had a small place with a futon just a few blocks away was also working late.  So I gave up on going home and am spending night in his little dorm like room.  In did manage to get everything thing done because of it.  And because we're a ten minute walk from DBC I'll get to sleep till 8 and still get there by 830.

So its a good day.

Highlights for the day:  
Use redirect after your routes to get to your next page.  
Routes should be named with plural nouns and then followed by the / and the action.  Such as posts/new  
You need to use double quotes with string interpolation  
Its okay practice to pass the object to the view if you're just going to use it to puts its attributes.

That's all form today.
