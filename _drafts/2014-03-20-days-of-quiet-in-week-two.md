title: Days of quiet in Week 2
---

So it's been a few days since I posted last. So I'm just going to post I short thing tonight.  Unfortunately, I got a cold over the weekend. This means not I must get home and get to bed as early as possible. this translates to getting home by nine and trying to be in bed by 10 p.m.  This cuts out the time for reflection and recording what's going on.

But as of Wednesday, I'm starting to learn magic of object oriented programming, as well as beginnings of the model vision controller framework.  I'm quite proud but I'm doing all of this, even though I've been sick. One way to think of this on the bright side, is that I can get my sickness out of the way in the first 3 weeks. Because, from what I understand, the second 3 weeks are far more intense.

Today's highlights include:  
1. Understanding for the first time single responsibility of classes.  
2. And creating our first app ever recorded data in a permanent state.  
3. And pushing through for a big day by asking to pair with my hello boot campers on today but I need support.

Its all for now time to sleep.
