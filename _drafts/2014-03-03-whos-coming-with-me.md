title: Who's Coming with Me!???
---
A few months ago I found myself typing out a late night email to send to the staff of the small city department where I have worked for the last 8 years.  This was a Jerry Maguire manifesto.


There were morale and energy issues in the department and I had an inspiration on how I could start something that would transform the growing apathy and frustration of the staff into empowered positivity.   I typed my impassioned plea for the staff to join me in an experiment that could change the department.  It came out in a fury and then I hovered my finger over the send button.  

It was 2:30 am. I buzzed with excitement.  This could have a real impact! This could make a change!  

But, the voice of doubt started to creep in:

_What if this is just crazy?  What if no one responds?  What if I regret it in the morning?  _

So I clicked save instead of send, and pledged to look over the email the next morning.  That email never made it out to the staff and the idea withered and died in a fog of self-doubt.

I tell this story because we are a week away from the Fiery Skippers Dev Bootcamp start date and this time I want to take that risk.  This time I want to hit send.  

I see the next 9 weeks as an amazing opportunity to reset my entire approach to work.  For most of my life I have had a job I did for money, and then after I punched clock I would become the real Jonathan.  I saved my true passions and intellectual curiosity for my nights and weekends. This isn't to say I didn't work hard at my day job.  I did.  And over the last year and a half I brought more and more of my personality out into my work.  But I can do more.  

When I recently discovered coding, I had flashes of a time where I could unify my work life and my personal exploration.  I now see a glimpse of a future where I get up to go to work and am excited because I get paid to do something I would do with my own free time.   I know that the next 9 weeks are a step in this direction.

My first priority for my time at DBC is to do everything possible to get the most out of our immersion experience.  I want set fire to every synapse I have and push my learning to its max.  I want to dream in code.

But this alone is not enough.  I want to recognize and take full advantage of the opportunities that come from being a beginner.  Right now, I know just enough, to know how much there is that I _don't know_.  I believe this is a great thing.

First, I don’t really have any deep habits with coding yet, good or bad, This means I can set out to learn not just coding over the next 9 weeks, but intentionally build the solid working habits that can sustain me for years and years of continued learning and developing.  If can do this, I will get what I came for.

I have a few ideas of habits or practices that I want to do because I believe they will have a lasting impact on my work and my life.  I also know from the pre-work thus far, that it’s hard to keep myself doing these very things.  It’s a short list and one that I hope to add on to during the program. 

1.  **Mediation:** I’ve practiced mediation for years, and believe that starting the day with a short 10 to 20 minute mediation, and then breaking up the work day with short (10 second to 5 minute) mediation breaks can help keep the mind fresh and awareness sharp.  I’ve never been able to sustain this at my day job, and would love to build this habit over the next 9 weeks.
2.  **Movement and Exercise:** Get up once every 30 minutes hour to move and get blood flowing.  And then exercise 4 times a week (if not every day).
3.  **Eat right:** I know that to the most out of the next 9 weeks I’m going to need to keep my body and mind at full capacity.  To me, this means not eating refined sugar or processed foods.  Also it means not snacking out of stress
4.  **Reflective Writing: ** I know I have struggled with this immensely during the prep phase.  But I know there is huge value to blogging about the concepts I’m learning in order to truly understand them on a deeper level.  I want to commit to daily short reflection and one long piece a week.

These are currently my four top practices that I want to bring to the work.  I’m sure that there are others out there who have their own best practices that they strive to embody. 

> **I’m making a call out to my fellow boot-campers to see if any of you want to band together and commit to supporting each other in the building of our personal best practices.  **

We would do this by reminders, gentle support and when needed, firm challenge.  Each person can bring and share their own list of personal practices and of course we can group together around practices that we share.   There are several ways we can do this and the details can be worked out later.

If you’re interested and want to discuss please shoot me an email or find me on google hangouts.  Also we can discuss when we all meet up next Monday.  I know that the work will start fast and furious, so I’d like to start this off early so that from starting gate I’m intentional about the habits I’m building. 

I look very much forward to seeing everyone shortly and hope this idea resonates with some of you. 

Go Fiery Skippers!
