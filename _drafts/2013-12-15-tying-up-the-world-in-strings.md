title: Tying Up the World in Strings

Strings! Strings.  Let's talk about strings! 

So strings are anything you can type into a computer that is NOT a number.  But wait, that's not really completely true, because strings can _have_ numbers in them.  But strings don't behave like numbers.  You can't do math with the numbers in strings, because the computer doesn't think of the "5" as the same thing as a 5.  To a computer the _5_ in the string is the same things as a a y or a @ or a u.  And you can't do math with an @ or an u or a 5 that's in a string.

But you can do one _kind of math_ with a string.  You can add strings together.  But you don't call that adding, you call that concatenation.  And it works differently then adding numbers.  

You know that 1 + 1 = 2.

But when you ad the strings "1" + "1" they don't equal 2, they equal "11".  That's because you are just taking the 1 and the 1 and smushing them together to make an "11."

Alright so I've been doing something that's a little sneaky without explaining it.  I've been throwing in these "" thingies.  These double quotes.  And I haven't explained why, so let me do that.

Computers mark the beginning and end of strings with either two double quotes, or two single quotes.

So a string is "         "

That's a string of blank space (space can be a string too!).

Or a string is 'string theory'

So when you put a number between two double quotes or two single quotes, it's not longer a number it's now a string.  And therefore you can't do math with it, you can only do string math with it, which pretty much is only the Concatenate function.

So to cap it all off: 5 + 5 = 10 (because those are numbers!)

and "5" + "5" = "55" (because those are both strings!)

And the one things a computer will never let you do, it will just freak out! Really it will freak out! it's not pretty.  You can't try to add a number to a string. 

So don't got asking it to 5 + "5".
