title: Phase 0 - Further Review

### 1. When you pass multiple arguments into a class or method using \* it is turned into an array.

You can then set that to any array in your class or even add it directly to another array.

### **2. Basics of Github: When you want to add to a git on git hub**

A. First fork off the git  
B. Clone your fork onto your machine  
C. Make the changes  
D. Push your changes to the fork  
E. Then create pull request for your fork  
F. Wait for author to accept

One day soon I'll be forking gits all over the place.

### 3. I resist reviewing my work in fear of not liking the old work,  need to push past this.

### 4. What is the proper way to put objects into arrays or hashes inside other objects?  Should you always set the object to a variable?  How should you call that object outside of the variable? Do you need to name it or can you just call it out by one of its attributes.

### 5. Don't forget that you can return to get out of an infinite loop, even in recursion
