title: Review and Reflect for Week 3 of DBC

---

I'm submitting all the challenges and reflecting on what I see in other bootcamper's code:

**the Die Challenge:**

new tricks:

is\_a?() method - this returns a boolean.  It test to see if the object you run it for actually is the class type that you pass into the argument. 

For instance: 7.is\_a?(Integer) = TRUE

"7".is\_a?(Integer) = FALSE

DIE 2 Challenge:

I learned about the new method sample.  In my code in order to roll the die used rand(@sides) to pick a random index of the @labels array passed into the Class.  

But there is a cooler way!  

Meet the method sample

sample selects a random object from an array, or a number of random objects from an array.

array = [1,2,3,4,5]

array.sample will return 1,2,3,4 or 5 randomly.

array.sample(2) will return two of the objects from the array randomly

nice!
