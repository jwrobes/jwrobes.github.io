title: Branchs upon Branches upon Branches

---

Simple Program Structure is without branches, everything just flowing one thing after another.  This is very limited obviously.  There are no forks in the road.  You can only go one route.  Very boring indeed.  This is called:

Sequential Programming

Now if you want to be able to go one direction in one scenario and another thing with a different scenario, you need to have choices, you need to have two options and you therefore you need to have branching.  This is called:

Selection Structure.

This is because you are selecting between two or more options based on some input.  I will go left if the sky is gray and right if the sky is blue.  I am selecting the branch of left and right (two options) based on the input of the color of the sky.  So:

Branching = Selection Structure
