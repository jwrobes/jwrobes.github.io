<p>I had to rush a bit through SQL when we did it in prep.  And even though I actually enjoyed it, I found it difficult to figure out how to understand some of the more elaborate query concepts.</p>
<p>So I came back to review them and see what I knew.  I went as far as the higher level Join stuff, and came onto a problem I couldn't solve.  </p>
<p>So what did I do?  First I reached out to two students to see if they could help. And then when they could not, I timeboxed it and tried to schedule a time to do the work with some help later.</p>
<p>What I didn't do was hit my head against the wall for hours.  </p>
<p>I call that progress.  Improving my learning techniques by being strategic about when it's time to move onto something that will be more productive.</p>
