<p>Computers are awesome.  And computers are awesome at numbers.  But computers get all confused when you start messing with numbers that are NOT integers.   So when I divide 3 by 2.  I don't blink.  I don't think.  I know.  It's 1.5.</p>
<p>But when you divide in 3/2 in ruby what do you get?  You get 1.  But wait, that's not right.  That's wrong. I thought computers were never wrong.  I thought they were perfect in every single way.  The platonic example of 0's and 1's.  Well, actually, it turns out that computers do this for a logical reason.  Or at least I think so.  There are a lot of questions where when you divide 3/2 the answer really is 1.</p>
<p>Like what you ask?  Well the example I remember is let's say you have 3 dollars in your pocket, and you want to buy a cup of coffee from starbucks.  I think coffee costs 1.90 or something, but let's just say it costs 2 bucks.  So how many cups of coffee can you buy with your 3 dollars?  Well let's do the math.  If you do it computer style, 3 / 2 = 1.  You get 1 cup of coffee.  But let's do it in the uncomputer way, 3/2 = 1.5.  Well can I get 1.5 cups of coffee from starbucks?  Have you tried that?  Well, try that tomorrow and see how well it goes over.  Take your three bucks and and ask for one and half cups of coffee.</p>
<p>So you see.  Computer's do the math in a very helpful way.  Maybe they are still perfect!  And then there is this other thing that helps you get the remainder after you divide.  It's called the modulo and is the "%" sign.  When you take 3 % 2 it will give you the 1 dollar left, so that you know you can take that dollar and by a scratch lotto ticket or something.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is a way to get the decimals, cause there are going to be times that you do want to know that 3/2 =1.5 Computer geeks call this floats.  And so to get a float you just need to add a float.  So instead of asking the computer 3/2 you can ask the computer 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 and it will give you the 1.5 you are looking for.</p>
<p>That's it for now.  More to come later</p>
