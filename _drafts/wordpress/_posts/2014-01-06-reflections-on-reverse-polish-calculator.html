<p>It's funny that the one things that got me stuck for awhile on this exercise was using CASE and WHEN.  Which happens to be the topic of my last published post.</p>
<p><strong>Careful with Case and Local Variables</strong></p>
<p>What I learned was this.  You can't pass a method argument directly as the Case.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>jump_high(feet)</p>
<p>  case feet</p>
<p>  when feet &lt; 4</p>
<p>    # do something</p>
<p>  when feet == 5</p>
<p>    # do something else</p>
<p>  else</p>
<p>    # do something completely different</p>
<p>  end</p>
<p>end</p>
<p>This does NOT work.  I found that I needed to set a new variable equal to the local method variable.  And use that as the case.  I don't quite understand why.  But I'll try to figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>DON'T FORGET REGEX</strong></p>
<p>I reviewed other people's solutions and saw a few using Regex and was struck at how I completely didn't even think about using Regex.  I need to make sure that I incorporate regex in my code consistently because it's such a great tool.  In fact I should make a check list of things to remember when I'm planning out code.  I'll start one now in Evernote.  The first thing will be</p>
<p>Can you use Regex?</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THIS MAGICAL SEND METHOD?</strong></p>
<p>In addition to seeing people using regex I saw some people using send, so I need to look into this.  I will get back to you on this send method tomorrow!</p>
