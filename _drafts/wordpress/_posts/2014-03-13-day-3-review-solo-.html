<li>I'm feeling good emotionally, pushing boundaries several times today.  Stepping up as method.  Going to code in front of group.  Checking in with David S.  How am I mentally? I'm fading a little.  I need to cut it off today at 8 and go home to get sleep and start early in the morning.</li>
<li>I'm feeling slow on the challenges.  I want to do the tough one (prime numbers), but I also want to complete the binary search from yesterday.  I don't know how much energy I'll have for that though.  Also I think going back and completing the Stack and Que from the morning to get the tic tac toe game actually working will be a good thing to do</li>
<li>Aha moments are recorded in Wordpress</li>
<li>What core competences do I want to focus on? Hashes.</li>
