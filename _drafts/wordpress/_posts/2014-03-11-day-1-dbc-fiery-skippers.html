<p>One day up.  One day down.  The adventure begins.  It's 10:19pm. I'm still here, but challenges submitted.</p>
<p>Highlights and Takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li> Bring a note pad tomorrow to write down each question as it comes up so I can have it ready when there is time to ask the question.</li>
<li>Shareef Bishay's introduction with the metaphor of restaurant vs. kitchen.  What is dev bootcamp to me?  Am I here to order from the menu, take what I want, and get the dessert of a job?  Or am I here to get into the kitchen and start cooking.  Can I make an impact at this place rather than just eat from the buffet?</li>
<li>Over and over again: ask questions and reflect.  Let's say it again.  Ask questions and reflect.</li>
<li>I need to ask help from the coaches a minimum of 3 times a week.  I have never been good a this.  I will do it now.  Take advantage of all the resources that they offer.</li>
<li>My pair was great, but we didn't do the 6pm check in.  I will do that tomorrow.  I will insist.</li>
<li>Instead of passing a bunch of arguments into a method, pass in a hash that has all those arguments and call those arguments from the using the key in the hash.  It's a best practice.  Very cool.</li>
<li>I still need to beef up on recursion.  I didn't figure out how to do numbers for words using recursion, but used small methods instead.  This leads into number 8.</li>
<li>Celebrate what you accomplish and be prepared to not complete everything.  So, woo hoo for getting the numbers into letters working in our own cool little way!  We were awesome!  (I'll get the recursion down this weekend)</li>
<li>Don't use case when, but instead use a hash to call the method.  I need to investigate this more when I refactor my numbers to words and get rid of the case when.</li>
<li>When you are going to do recursion. GO TO THE WHITEBOARD.  Start with the first break.  And move from there.</li>
<li>It's a dream to be doing this.  I get to come here and swim in a room full of passion, excitement, and courage.  Just being in this every day for 9 weeks is going to change me. </li>
<li>I need to set up in my email a message explaining why I won't be getting back to anyone for the next 9 weeks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Day one down.  62 more to go.</p>
