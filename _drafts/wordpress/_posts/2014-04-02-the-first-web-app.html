<p>So it has been a day of a few firsts.&nbsp; The first web app.&nbsp; A low budget version of Craigslist using Sinatra and postgress.&nbsp; We had a group of three, which resulted in men tackling the challenge solo because three in one group doesn't work so well.&nbsp; So it was a long slog of a day, with me unsure half way through how routes and parameters really worked.&nbsp; But I pushed through, and ended the day with a functioning version of Craigslist.&nbsp; Not bad, for one day.</p>
<p>The second first was not making it home.&nbsp; I found myself working late at 11pm and my buddy whom had a small place with a futon just a few blocks away was also working late.&nbsp; So I gave up on going home and am spending night in his little dorm like room.&nbsp; In did manage to get everything thing done because of it.&nbsp; And because we're a ten minute walk from DBC I'll get to sleep till 8 and still get there by 830.</p>
<p>So its a good day.</p>
<p>Highlights for the day:<br />
Use redirect after your routes to get to your next page.<br />
Routes should be named with plural nouns and then followed by the / and the action.&nbsp; Such as posts/new<br />
You need to use double quotes with string interpolation<br />
Its okay practice to pass the object to the view if you're just going to use it to puts its attributes.</p>
<p>That's all form today.</p>
