<p>Dev Bootcamp is seven days away and today was a day for catching up for last week.  I had to make up for the work time I lost last week as I closed my final week at my job for the Department of Children, Youth and their Families (DCYF).</p>
<p>There was a sense of urgency, I wanted to get through the mandatory exercises from last week all today, so I could take one and complete the extra reviews ones tomorrow.  This way by Wednesday I'll be caught up and focused on this week's work.  I don't like that I feel like I'm cramming in the last week, but I will have every day until Monday to work and this will be the longest stretch of coding days I could string together since I started the prep work.</p>
<p>There were a few surprises today and some things I forgot but want to take note of.</p>
<p><strong>Magic of Implicit Return</strong></p>
<p>I discovered that if the a function will return the last object even if you run a method on that object.  For example, when I close a method with:</p>
<p>array.each {|x| puts x}</p>
<p>I will get both the outputs of the puts x AND I will return the array.  To further clarify this point, I'll put in some method.</p>
<p>If I run the method</p>
<p>foo()<br />
The output is<br />
2<br />
3<br />
4</p>
<p>But when get the class like this:<br />
puts foo().class =&gt; array</p>
<p>I actually get the array.</p>
<p>The function is returning the array and not just the output. This surprised me.</p>
