<p>So after a full day of review and catch up work I'm coming home at 1130 pm on the train.&nbsp; So here are some if the highlights of the past few days.</p>
<p>1. Getting healthy.&nbsp; Much more fun to do this without a cold.&nbsp; I hope that today's marathon session doesn't threaten that.</p>
<p>2. MVC.&nbsp; It's a simple concept on paper, but tricky to start implementing concretely.&nbsp; But it's the beginnings of a lot of fun stuff.&nbsp; The ability to change or add features without creating too much havoc is brilliant.</p>
<p>3. Git add -p and git commit -v&nbsp; Thus little tips and habits are things I'll do a billion times from here on out.</p>
<p>4. Sticking it out to really understand the basics of ruby and SQL so I can start using active record with a strong foundation.&nbsp; It won't just be magic.</p>
<p>5. The learning curve if working in a group.&nbsp; I get along well with people, but that doesn't mean I don't have a lit to learn in team dynamics.&nbsp; I got to notice all these competing urges that arise when I'm teaming up.  I want to be a facilitator. I want to be right.  I'm afraid I will be outshone.  I like structure over chaos.  There is a lot if room for me to grow.</p>
<p>That's all for now.</p>
