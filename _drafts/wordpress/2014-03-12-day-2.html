<p>This morning I woke up and told my wife that I think I found heaven.  I meant it.  Yesterday I found a place that was a heaven for learning and growth.  </p>
<p>Today I got to experience what a heaven for growth and learning feels like.  And I just got a small whiff.  The short summary is this.  They say be prepared to not finish everything and fall behind.  You smile and nod, sure, sure.  I hear you.  I'll be ready for that.  And then bam.  You fall behind and suddenly I must actually face my feelings about falling behind and not completing every challenge.  Nothing beats the actual experience.  And I can feel the urge to stay up all hours to get more done.  And now I must combat that urge and make sure I don't sleep deprive myself on day three despite all the warnings.</p>
<p>Next, we had our Engineering Empathy course.  It was challenging in many ways.  And the conversations it sparked afterwards were even more interesting.   The challenge for me is stepping into a strong opinion, regardless of how it is perceived.  I care too much about what others thing sometimes to stick to any side of any position.  And today I found myself faced head on with that.  I am comfortable as the peacemaker.  I'm comfortable with no conflict.  But I want to grow past this.  I want to step into a side, regardless of how that changes others perception of me.  This is will not change in 9 weeks.  But I will continue to work on this.</p>
<p>So that's some highlights from the mushy stuff.  But we did spend a lot of time on the mushy stuff.  Two hours on empathy.  Forty-five minutes in yoga.  (Is yoga mushy?)  And then we had the lectures.  About three hours or more of lectures on the basics of algorithms and more.</p>
<p>And then there was the code.  We spent the morning refactoring solutions from yesterday's challenge.  And the second half of the day working on creating search algorithms, linear, binary and more.  I didn't not have enough time to do it all.  And so there is more to be done.  And now there is a little game of catch up.  Day 2 and it's catch up time already.</p>
<p>So here are some highlights of the day:</p>
<ol>
<li>method 7.div_sum(3): This returns in an array both the divisor and the remainder of the number divided by the integer. So it return [2,1]</li>
<li>IRB evaluates certain code differently than when you run it a script.  Namely, it evaluates one line at a time.</li>
<li>When starting a pair, it's a good idea to identify the goals for the pairing session.  Specifically, how many challenges do we want to tackle and complete in order to feel good.  That way we can schedule for that.  Check our progress.  And make informed choices and strategic time boxing so we come out of the session happy.</li>
<li>I am committing to volunteer the next time I get a chance to take the white board for a challenged.  I want to get practice with that early and often.</li>
<li>when the user inputs through a gets.chomp you can push each input into an array directly</li>
</ol>
<p>That's all for today.  I must fix my count down because the end date I believe is May 16th (this could be wrong) If it's not we ahve So instead of moving to day 65 days left.  That doesn't sound right.  I'll double check on that tomorrow.</p>
<p>Oh, and the good deed of the day for me?  I took a big parking ticket off my wife's car this morning so she wouldn't have the start the day of with that.</p>
