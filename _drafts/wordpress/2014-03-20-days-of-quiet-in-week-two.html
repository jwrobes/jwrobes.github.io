<p>So it's been a few days since I posted last. So I'm just going to post I short thing tonight.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I got a cold over the weekend. This means not I must get home and get to bed as early as possible. this translates to getting home by nine and trying to be in bed by 10 p.m.&nbsp; This cuts out the time for reflection and recording what's going on.</p>
<p>But as of Wednesday, I'm starting to learn magic of object oriented programming, as well as beginnings of the model vision controller framework.&nbsp; I'm quite proud but I'm doing all of this, even though I've been sick. One way to think of this on the bright side, is that I can get my sickness out of the way in the first 3 weeks. Because, from what I understand, the second 3 weeks are far more intense.</p>
<p>Today's highlights include:<br />
1. Understanding for the first time single responsibility of classes.<br />
2. And creating our first app ever recorded data in a permanent state.<br />
3. And pushing through for a big day by asking to pair with my hello boot campers on today but I need support.</p>
<p>Its all for now time to sleep.</p>
