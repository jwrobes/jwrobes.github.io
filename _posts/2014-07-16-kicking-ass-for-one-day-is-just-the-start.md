title: What a difference a day makes...
description: Looking for jobs when sticking to your schedule is so much fun!  But it's easy for day one...what about day two?
---

So here was my list from yesterday.  And I'll be damned if it didn't work like a charm:  

1. Make a schedule
2. Follow that schedule
3. Stop every two hours and eat some fruit
4. Exercise
 
I pretty much stuck to yesterday's schedule except I didn't make it to Oakland meetup or watch the Americans.  I instead prepped for a Swift Study group this morning by watching the intro video and skimming the book. 

Today's schedule is this:

	6:45 - Blog
	8:00 - Swift Study Meetup group in SF
	10:00 - Resumes and Contact Emails
	12:00 -  Lunch and run around the lake
	1:30 - Moments project work
	4:00 - Catch up with buddy (3 hours)
	7:00 - Dinner
	8:00 - Return to Moments Project (2 hours)
<br>

This schedule could be changed up a bit because catching up with buddy may change and I might get out to either pick up a standing desk tonight or go to Javascript meetup.
 
I am aware taht this whole publishing my schedule on my blog is a bit self centered.  And those few people who may be reading this may find this boring as hell.  But, for now I'm finding a power in declaring the schedule somewhat publicly.  It helps me keep accountable in a way.  This may not be a daily thing, and maybe I can put this somewhere else if it does, but it's just day two.

I'm excited about this morning's Swift study group, though I have a few doubts on whether trying to dive into a new language is the best thing for me right now.  I'm working increasing my RoR knowledge through my app.  I'm super excited about Node and plan to build the Moments app in that as soon as I get a respectable version of it up using RoR.  And now I'm going to be dipping my toe into Swift.

I feel that maybe this is spreading my learning too thin, and that it's better to just focus on the the languages I already have some experience on and deepening my understanding of those.  But there's something so exciting about jumping into Swift at its inception and I do want to learn how to build a mobile app.  So I'm going to have some fun and play with this little meetup anyways.

One last note, yesterday I finally signed up for a Meetup called Consciousness Hacking.  There was an intro video by the leader of the meetup that summed up what he means by consciousness hacking.  And what he's working on is basically the epitome of what I'm excited about in regards to technology.  I will definitely go to the next meetup and hopefully will get to have tea or something with him before then.  It was super inspiring because I feel like I want to work with him on whatever he's doing and I now have some skills with which I can be build things.
