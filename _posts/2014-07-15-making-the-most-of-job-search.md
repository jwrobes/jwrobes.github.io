title: Getting Good at Job Search
description: How I can become a better person by making the most of my job search.

Dev Bootcamp was amazing.  I loved it.  I love coding.  

Job searching...not such much.

I was hoping to skip this process all together.  Dev Bootcamp marketed me to a company I would have been happy to work at.  I had two culture interviews, that led to a technical interview.  However, they hired other developers from my class and filled their quota for Junior Devs before I ever got to come in a code.  My hope for an easy transition from Dev to job, without the stress of job search was dashed.

Since then I've been on my own.  And thus far, I have to admit, I haven't been kicking job searching ass.  

If I had to pinpoint one reason that I don't like job searching, it comes down to my battle with impostor syndrome.  Somehow after all the hours of work, all that I've learned I struggle believing I have what it takes to be a developer.  I know I love it.  I love the learning.  But the mind starts creeping in and says, I need to learn more before I really am a developer.  

I also have come to understand that my years struggling with my identity as a screenwriter left some bad habits that I am transferring to my start as a developer.  In short, I spent many years struggling at writing, never quite believing that I would ever get to the point where this thing that I loved would ever make me money.  The fact is that this belief was grounded in reality.  

Now coding is this new thing that I love.  I ache to do it in the same way I ached to write.  The fact is that right now, it's a much more in demand skill than screenwriting.  I will get paid to do it.  But there is a part of me that transfers that emotional belief that there's no way I'll get paid to do something I love from screenwriting to coding.  It's not rational, but it's there.  And it is making this transition much harder than it should be.  And it's adding fuel to the impostor syndrome that I believe many developers face, and especially new ones from bootcamps.

So for the last few weeks I've gone through my days driven by emotion.  I would code to avoid sending out resumes and cover letters.  And when I got stuck in a project, it would seed doubt in my overall value as a developer and make it harder for me to bring confidence to my job search.  I would look at job postings and think, I can't do that, I can't figure out how to develop a Parallax style landing page in four hours, I'm not ready for that.

But today my wife woke up and shared some tidbits of knowledge she got from a program she's doing to prepare for her MFT licensing exam.  None of it is revelatory.  It's quite simple.  Here it is:

1. Make a schedule
2. Follow that schedule
3. Stop every two hours and eat some fruit
4. Exercise

Duh!  These are simple things.  I've been doing them only half way.   I need to do them fully.  

Suddenly I'm seeing this job search not as a burden, but as a way to really strengthen my confidence and self structure.  
>##I don't have to hate job search, I just need to get good at it.  

And so that's the plan.  

Today's schedule is this:

	9:00 - Typing Practice 
	9:30 - Blog
	10:00 - Moments Project
	12:00 -  Lunch and run around the lake
	1:30 - Meet with Robert to catch up and maybe get some leads on jobs
	3:30 - Send out resumes
	5:00 - Return to Moments Project
	6:30 - dinner and coding with Gabe or Oakland Meetup
	9:00 - Day is done -- watch the Americans 

<br>

It's a nice schedule, packed with coding.  Only a little resume sending out, but it's a step in the right direction.  Also I think after meeting with Robert I'll be in a good place to send out some resumes.  

I'll keep track of all the work using the Tomato system to take 5 minute breaks every 25 minutes and 15 minute breaks for fruit every two hours.

This is about taking control of my own job search and getting good at it.  Let's do this!
