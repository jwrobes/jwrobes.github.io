title: Getting excited about all the possibilities.
description: As momentum is building each day in my new aim at becoming a good job hunter, I am getting back in touch with how awesome this new career is going to be.

So first let me look back at how I did with  yesterday's schedule.  I basically did everything but run yesterday, and I ended up working in the Moments project until 1:30 am.  So I coded more and exercised less.  
I also realize when I code late into the night I have a harder time sticking to the structure of breaking for five minutes every 25 minutes.  I end up going for hours without a break, driven by the need to fix bugs and get stuff done.  So next time I'm going to work late I'm going to make a point of sticking strong to the Tomatoes structure.

So what about some  good news.  Yesterday's job applications resulted in a call from a recruiter that turned into a meeting today.  They have some companies that may be a good fit for me.  Talk about instant gratification, two days of good job hunting pays off.  I'm not getting too excited, I don't have experience with recruiters, so I don't know what to expect or if they will actually help.  I still am going to be sending out resumes and keep putting myself out there.

I also had a call this morning with a founder of a start up looking for a Technical Co-founder.  It was a great talk and I like what they are doing.  The question is whether it's best for me to take one a challenge and risk like that, or to seek out a situation with more mentorship and structure to build my skills.  I'm leaning toward the latter, but there is something ballsy about taking on this challenge.  I might learn more in building something from the ground up then working on a team.  I could also take on a smaller role possibly and just help them build their product for experience and fun.  

And how about the Moment's project?  Well I got the fancy Parallax Landing page up and I cleaned up a ton of the structure.  I moved things into their proper controllers and added Ajax when it was appropriate.  Right now the latest is up, but there are a few bugs to fix.  I can't express how much fun it is to work on this.  I just want to do it all the time.  But I have to balance the project work with the rest of my responsibilities.  

My goals are to fix the Ajax, add a background job that searches for moments that should have been sent out, but were not, and sends them out.  I also want to add a time stamp to the texts so I can compare when they are supposed to go out versus when they actually arrive.  Then I want to work on testing.  It's backwards, I did not do TDD for this and I'm making a promise now that for the next project I'm going to approach it pure TDD, just to get the experience of it.  But I want to add a ton of unit tests and then get to refactoring some of the very fat controllers and models by building some helpers and concerns.  


And all of that is a precursor for the real work of making it load faster.  The huge images that are on the landing page make it way too slow.  I believe there is some way to load a quick background and the text first and have the images load after that.  Eventually, I want to not use skrollr for the parallax, but build my own version of it that will be much smoother.  

So...there's a ton left to do.
