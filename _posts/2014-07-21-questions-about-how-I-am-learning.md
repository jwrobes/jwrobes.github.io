title: Questions about how I'm learning? Is it the right way?
description: I struggled for one day with my sidekiq and sidetiq issue and switched from using that gem to using Resque and Resque Scheduler.  I have not solved the bug yet, and will continue to tackle it today, but I have questions about whether I am learning in the optimal way.

One of the pieces of advice I hear most about how to learn programming is to pick a project you want to build and just build it.  The thinking is that you will be motivated to learn new things as you need to incorporate them into your project.  It makes a lot of sense and that's one of the big reasons I'm hacking away at this little app for now a week and a half straight.  I want the app to work. I want it for my own use.  And I want to learn by building it.

The question that I have after this weekend is whether the drive to get it working can get in the way of learning.  Does the pull to get it up in working drive me to quickly over concepts I should be focusing more time on?  Just getting something to work doesn't mean I am truly grokking what I needed to do to get it work.  And it doesn't mean I'm getting it to work following best practices.  I feel that that maybe focusing too much on the app itself, at the expense of really deepening my understanding of what I'm doing to get the app running is maybe costing me the true benefits of working on personal projects.  But it's hard to not be driven by the pull to get the thing working.  But if I get it working and don't understand why one strategy works versus the other, am I really gaining anything out of the project?

I think to really avoid this trap I need to actually do more than just build the app.  I need to be intentional about what I'm struggling with, what are the things that are my blockers and then making time to dive deep into those blockers.  This will undoubtedly mean I spend less time just working on the app.  It will slow down progress, but it will ensure that I'm maximizing the benefits of the project.  The goal can't realistically be just to build a little app that few people may ever use.  The goal has to be to learn as much as I can through building the app.  With that in mind I am going to start identifying concepts that I'm running into while building this app budget time to dive deep and understand them.  Even at the expense of slowing down my progress.  And to really ensure I'm getting them I will have to identify them here and write a special blog post that explains the concept in my own words.  

Today's concept, threading.  Single threads and multiple threads.  What does this really mean?

Here is the schedule for the day:

		7:30 - Typing practice
		8:00 - blog
		8:30 - breakfast and emails
		9:00 - Studying threads (first draft of blog post)
		11:30 - Run
		12:00 - Lunch 
		1:00 - Send out applications and letters 
		3:00 - Moments app
		5:00 - prep dinner for friend
