title: Service objects and the promise of TDD.
description: My meetup last night introduced me into Extreme Programming and energized me around writing cleaner, testable, single responsibility code.
---

Last night I attended a meetup at Pivotal Labs called Extreme Tuesdays club, which I knew very little about.  I knew Pivotal Labs, but I understood only vaguely what was met by Extreme Programming.  A simple Wikipedia search has now remedied that.  I wasn't really going to the meeting because of the Extreme programming anyway.  I really just needed to go out and talk with other programmers, get some questions answered and pull myself out into the world.  

It worked.  

I came out grounded, inspired, and even got some guidance on how to improve my Moments app.

First off, I did not build my app with strong testing or TDD.  I have written some tests, but not anything close to TDD.  I have been mulling over committing to whatever next project I work on, to tackle it with complete TDD style.  I believe the only way I'm going to get good at this is to really do it completely.  I also learned that another benefit of actually building in the Extreme Programming way, is that it can lead to better Object Oriented practices.  I will write much cleaner code because I'll be building it one test at a time.  

The other big takeaway from last night is that it seems that one big improvement I can have with the Moments project is to move all the business logic out of the controllers and background jobs workers into service objects.  This is brand new, but simple concept for me.  I'm excited to go through my app and start applying it. This will also give me the chance to increase the test coverage.
