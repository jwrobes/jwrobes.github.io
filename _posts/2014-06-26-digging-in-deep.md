Post Bootcamp the biggest challenge is choosing what to focus my time on.  The tension between building things and digging deeper into learning the fundamentals is the main conflict.  And then there is my humbling daily practice of becoming a touch typer.

One of the nicest things about Dev Bootcamp, and any bootcamp I imagine, is the simple clarity of how to focus your time.  You have the daily challenges, the solid direction of the curriculum, the energy of all the students in the building.  This all comes together to encourage an amazing amount of productivity and an unbeleivable amount of learning in a short time.  

Now that six weeks have passed since I graduated DBC, I have come to understand and appreciate the challenge of working on your own to continue your learning.   At its heart it comes down to the fact that there are so many different things I want to learn, and yet bouncing around from one to the other is not the most effective way to learn.  

Also there are the pressures of looking for a job and the preparation for the coming technical interviews which also motivate what I want to focus on.  

So what do I have going on right now?  I have three projects I'm working on.  I am digging deeper in understanding algorithms and data structures.  And I'm working on digging deeper.
