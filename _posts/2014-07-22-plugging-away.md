description: Plugging away.  What is the proper pace of learning?  And why I need to reach out more.

What I miss about Dev Bootcamp was that confidence that I was learning at an incredible pace.  As I'm working on my own now, it's hard to have that confidence.  So yesterday I figured out how to move my app from Sidekiq and Sidetiq for the schedule background jobs to Resque and Resque Scheduler.  I was hoping to get all that done over the weekend, but I didn't.  Still at 1 am last night I got the Resque worker humming alone and checking for moments to send out and sending them out.  Success!

I also dived into what a thread and a process is, and I dipped my toe into the difference between Sidekiq and Resque.  Sidekiq uses multi-threads to run workers and Resque uses forks.  Now I understand threads more today, and I have a very basic idea of forks.  But to really understand all of this I need more than just me.  I'm coming to realize more and more that why Dev Bootcamp worked well for me is that I have a social learning style.  I like to get into concepts on my own, but then I need someone to discuss those concepts in order to truly understand them.  I am trying to use the blog post as a way to do that, but I think I really need a study group.  

This is why I need to reach out to my fellow students more.  So this week, I'm reaching out to fellow students and I'm going to make sure I grok both of these concepts.  I don't just want to get my app to work, I want to understand why it works.  That is the entire point of building it.
