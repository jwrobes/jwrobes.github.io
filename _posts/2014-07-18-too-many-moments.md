title: Moments and moments...and then more moments!
description: One benefit of building and testing an app that reminds you to take moments in your day to stop and practice awareness, is that I end up taking a lot of moments.

Day three of getting good at getting a job went well.  Already this is getting to be a bit boring to blog about.  I'll keep it up though because it's  still helping keep me on task and upbeat.  I soon want to transfer this blog from my mundane personal daily job search to focus on sharing the concepts that I'm learning in programming.  Those kind of posts are much more work and will take some time, but will be much more valuable for me.

Yesterday, I ironed out some of the bugs in my moments app, and added some new ones.  At one point I started getting reminders to take a moment one after another, as it started cycling through all the old moments that had not been marked as sent, and sending them all at once.  My phone was blowing up! Take a moment! Take a moment!  I am trying to take advantage of these test reminders and actually take all those moments.  And you know what?  It is changing the overall feeling of my day.  Go figure, maybe this whole app is more than just a fun little project, maybe it will offer something useful to me and others?

On a complete side note.  Last night I caught up with my buddy Kelley and we saw the best summer action movie that you have never heard of, Snowpiercer. If you have heard of it, you're a bit of a movie guy like me.  It's not all that secret, it's been written about quite a [bit.](http://grantland.com/features/transformers-snowpiercer-review-the-rover/)  It lived up to the hype, and minus just a few over the top and unnecessary monologues, was a really amazing movie.  If you can see it in the theater, I say go see it.

So here's today's schedule, the new thing I need to incorporate is some serious daily technical interview prep.  I'm going to get some interviews soon and I need to be ready.

Today's schedule is this:

		8:00 - typing practice
		8:45 - Blogging
		9:30 - Tennis
		11:30 - send out applications and emails
		1:00 - lunch
		1:30 - moments app
		3:30 - interview prep
		5:30 - moments app
		7:00 - go see dance performance with wifey
