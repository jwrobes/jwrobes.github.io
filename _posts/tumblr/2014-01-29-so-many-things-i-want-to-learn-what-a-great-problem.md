So yesterday I built my first website following a tutorial from Tree House.  It’s not really mine because I just followed the directions, but I did write it all down in html, type up the css, and then upload it to my server to host.  
I would share it, but I’ll save that for the next project when I actually customize it and make it more mine.  I’m excited!  Front end development leads to the immediate gratification of creating something, throwing it up on the web and then bam! It’s there for all the world to see (and ignore most likely).  There was something very satisfying about just getting over that little hump.
Speaking of getting over humps.  That reminds me of something.  I really want to declare to the world that I enjoy being a beginner.  To be honest, I’m not really good at it.  It doesn’t come naturally.  I want to be an expert.  I want to know it all.  And I want to know it all yesterday.
Even though I have that voice inside I know on a deeper level that being a beginner is really the most beautiful thing in the world.  I could get all zen and start talking about the beginner’s mind and stuff, but not tonight.  
I’ll just say this. 
When you’re young we get to have so many firsts.  I remember quite vividly when I lived in the Hollywood Hills some years ago, I was renting a movie at Blockbuster (I know, wow, so dated!) and there was this mother pushing around her toddler in stroller while chewing bubble gum.  The mom would blow a big bubble and her son would explode with joy as it got big and then popped.  The baby did this over and over and over again.  I mean that was probably the first bubble gum bubble that baby had ever seen.  It was amazing!  
Now  when we get older we are in danger of making life choices that lead us away from experiencing firsts.  in fact we may even start to fear them.  In my case I actually pre-judge myself for having not done that new thing yet.  
"Jonathan, I can’t believe you haven’t water skied yet!  What an embarrassment!"
And then if I do that new thing, I may rush through the first time so I can get to the point where I’m no longer a beginner.  Let me just get through that awkward, don’t know, foul things up, get things wrong and make mistakes phase into something that has the illusion of being much safer.
The stage where I can fool myself into thinking that I know what to do.  
But this is all wrong!  Well mostly.  It’s good to get good at things.  It’s good to build skills.  Look, you can’t be a good pianist unless you can rip through your scales.  But being a beginner can have it’s own magical rewards.  If you can just allow yourself to be a beginner, let yourself learn without judgment, foul things up, break things, look “stupid” you can do great things!  
So I want to celebrate being a beginner.   Before yesterday I never had actually uploaded my own html, css and img files on to a server and pointed a url at it to make a real website.  I can only post my first files online once.  And I did that yesterday.  I can only create my own first website once! I’ll do that Thursday. What a joy! 
I think one of the keys to a fulfilling life is to never shy away from being a beginner, because that means you’ll always be growing.  
Let me be that baby laughing at the endless firsts of bubble gum popping!
(I have to admit I googled to make sure I used the term front end developer correctly. I did use it correctly. Yeah to being a beginner!)
