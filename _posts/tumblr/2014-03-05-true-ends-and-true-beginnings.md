True Ends
Yesterday I officially did my last bit of work for DCYF.  There was something poetic about it, because my last minutes were spent going through excel spreadsheets and using countif to copy and paste matches from one dataset to another.  If that’s all nonsense to you, then you haven’t spend the last few years living in the world of excel like I did.
I will miss the people, I will miss the big picture of the work, knowing that while I’m lost in the weeds of a vlookup formula or for the millionth time cleaning up agency and program names from one spreadsheet so that I can match them to another spreadsheet, that behind all those numbers on the screen are thousands of children in SF being served by DCYF funded programs.
In FY1213 DCYF served around 35,000 of San Francisco’s 0 to 18 year olds.  Around two out of every three children (ages 5 to 18) in the highest need neighborhoods such as the Bayview, attended a program funded by DCYF for at least an hour.  
The point is that I always had a complete faith in the ultimate mission of our department.  I got to come home knowing that I spent my day serving children and youth, even though I was about a hundred steps removed from the direct work with them.  
I hope that my new path leads me not to far astray from that feeling.  I am nourished by adding value to the world.  There are a lot of ways to do this, and so I’m excited to get new skills with which I can explore ways to give something to humans.  That said, I don’t want to be using excel anymore, I want to be coding in ruby, javascript, solving puzzles, and building new things.  
True Beginnings
After I left my old office for the last time around noon, I headed out to the presidio to meet some of my future classmates at their Hacker House in the presidio.  I had “met” all of them before through google hangouts and our code pairing sessions online.  But nothing ever stands in for a real life 3d hand shake or hug (no 3d glasses required). 
First off, DS guided us in a mediation.  I’m so excited to integrate this practice into my work life and to have support in doing so.  It was an amazing start.  
Then we plopped down and started working side by side together at their setup of two tables with a bunch of monitors.   What struck me was that there is a strange balance of isolation and social interaction, when a room full of people are side by side coding on their own projects.  You’re together, but you’re each far off in your own head.  I haven’t done too much coding live with others yet, just a few Sundays here and there with AS and I realize that it will be a new experience for me.  
When at the end of the night we started tackling a challenge together, it was both exhilarating and challenging.  I’ll speak for myself when I say that I have not experience in planning out code for a group, so I’m kind of making up the process as I go along.  And there definitely is a skill in successfully coding around a project together, so I’m looking forward to getting to build that skill.  At this stage I just want to be upfront of what I don’t know, open to sharing my gut instincts and ideas, while consciously being open to others ideas.  I want to be confident in mine, while also flexible enough to throw them out when someone else has a better idea.  This is not immediately easy, so I’m going to focus on building those muscles.
This is going to be an adventure.  A short, exhilarating adventure.  I have some great people to take the ride with.
Go Skippers!
