Five short thoughts on the weekend of code
Refactoring code is hard for me.  Refactoring code is very very important.  I will need to get more guidance and build more confidence around the cleaning up of my and other’s code.  I noticed today that this part of coding taps into some of my bad habits that are carrying over from screenwriting.  I can spend way too much time going in circles of self doubt and questioning.  I will fix something.  Then I’ll unfix it.  Then I’ll fix something else and so on.
I didn’t run enough.  I need to work more physical activity into my days.
I did catch up with everything!  I didn’t get to tackle the one big BONUS CHALLENGE I was hoping to crash into.  I want to be ahead of the curve in terms of being prepared, but even though I’m spending all my weekend virtually coding, I am just keeping up.  I did need to catch up this week from last weekend’s lack of coding.  So maybe next week will be different.
Coding actually can be a great distraction.  Our sump pump failed in the basement this weekend.  That means there is shit in the basement.  Literally.  And this was very stressful because we actually can’t get it fixed until tomorrow.  But code actually was a great place to get lost and forget the constant level of stress that permeated from yesterday afternoon until the plumber finally came today.
When I get to do this full time and not just on the weekends and at nights.  That will be awesome.  
Okay I lied.  One more.  I’m still a long long way from being in a place where all of this learning comes together for me.
