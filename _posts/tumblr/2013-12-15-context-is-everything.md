So, I just jumped into this thing without any preamble or explanation.  It’s a good way to start movie, just jump into the scene.  It’s drama 101, start the scene after the beginning and end before the end.  
Well, this isn’t a movie, so I’ll give some context but keep it short.  I’m 90 days out from starting an intense program where I’ll learn to code in 9 weeks.  This is the first big jump in my career since I’ve stopped writing screenplays two years ago.  This whole decision to make the jump came fundamentally from the realization that I loved writing screenplays because I loved getting lost in worlds and creating things.  And I believe coding will be a new way to do both of those things.  I plan to get lost in coding and build some stuff.  And the big difference between them, you run code and it works or it doesn’t.  No way to do that with a screenplay ( well not yet!).
So I’m going to use this place to record my journey.  I’ll try to post often, but I know every blog starts with that intention, and most die out.  So we’ll see.
As for today, I’ve finished all the prep exercises.  When I got them last week I freaked out, I hadn’t gotten through all the prep material (most of it). And so I was worried I was going to not be able to do the exercises in the suggested 6 to 8 hours.  
But I did.  Now I’m going back to try to finish the rest of the prep work, namely, complete the Java Script section, review the HTML and practice a lot of explaining of the different topics so I can be sure to have a good handle on them.  
I’m excited, but nervous.  I’m looking forward to some guidance on how much work I should be doing on this and where I’m at in the prep process.
