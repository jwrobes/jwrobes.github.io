It’s coming.  The time is nigh.
So what does it feel like to be so close to such exciting and scary stuff.  It feels to me like the the water ripple in the glass scene from Jurassic Park.  Of course that means that means I’m equating Dev Bootcamp to the tyrannosaurus rex.  But from current view point, that sounds about right.  
Except that I plan on lassoing that rex, hopping on and riding the beast bareback all the way to the moon!
One can dream right!
