h2. About J-Wrobes 

h5. (_aka Jonathan Wrobel_)

I am a new developer.  An old soul.  A dreamer.  A husband.  An adventurer.  A film nerd. 

And one night many years ago I lost a run off in a freestyle rap battle in downtown Providence, RI.  
I lost the battle but I walked off with name j-wrobes.  (That's pronounced J - Robes with a silent W) 
And after years as Jonathan I am starting to grow into my own stage name.
